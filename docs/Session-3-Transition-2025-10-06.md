# Session 3 Transition - October 6, 2025

## Session Summary
Fixed critical Python PATH issues preventing scheduled task reliability and completed deployment script improvements.

## Current Status: READY FOR CLEAN DEPLOYMENT TESTING

### ✅ Completed This Session

**Major Fixes:**
1. **Python PATH Reliability (CRITICAL FIX)**
   - SystemChecks.psm1: Added `Find-PythonExecutable` function to search common locations
   - Start-WebServer.ps1: Uses full Python path instead of relying on PATH variable
   - Deploy-RKSystem.ps1: Adds Python to System PATH after installation (requires admin)
   - **Result:** Web server can now start from scheduled tasks reliably

2. **PowerShell 5.1 Compatibility**
   - Configuration.psm1: Added `ConvertTo-Hashtable` helper function
   - Removed `-AsHashtable` parameter (PowerShell 6.0+ only)

3. **Deployment Script Improvements**
   - Step 5: Direct content copy instead of calling Update-Manual.ps1
   - Prevents false "corruption" detection during initial deployment

4. **Uninstall Script Fixes**
   - Fixed variable reference syntax errors (`$taskName:` → `${taskName}:`)
   - Script now runs without parser errors

5. **Content Structure**
   - Added README.md to repository (Docsify landing page)
   - Fixed _sidebar.md with proper markdown links (moved from Test files/ to root)
   - Docsify navigation working correctly

**Testing Completed on Office2:**
- ✅ Deployment script runs without errors
- ✅ Web server starts successfully
- ✅ Docsify UI displays with working navigation
- ✅ Uninstall script removes all components
- ⚠️ Scheduled task reliability issue identified and fixed (Python PATH)

### 🔄 Next Steps (Option B - Complete Validation)

**On Office2:**
1. Pull latest changes from GitHub
2. Run `Uninstall-RKSystem.ps1` for clean slate
3. Run fresh `Deploy-RKSystem.ps1` with admin privileges
4. Verify Python in System PATH: `$env:PATH -split ';' | Where-Object { $_ -like "*Python*" }`
5. Test immediate web server start
6. Restart Office2 and confirm scheduled task auto-starts web server
7. Test after sleep/wake cycles
8. Verify web server restarts reliably

### 🚨 Known Issues to Monitor

1. **Desktop Shortcuts**
   - Only "Refresh Rob's Manual.bat" currently created
   - Need to add "Rob's Computer Manual.url" shortcut (opens browser to localhost:8080)
   - Deploy-RKSystem.ps1 Step 6 needs update

2. **Misleading Status Messages**
   - Deploy Step 9 shows "[!] Web server may not have started properly" even when successful
   - Health-Check marks web server as FAILED even when running
   - Status reporting needs improvement (cosmetic issue, doesn't affect functionality)

3. **Unapproved PowerShell Verbs**
   - Recovery.psm1 functions use non-standard verbs (Backup-, Deploy-, Repair-)
   - Causes warning but doesn't affect functionality
   - Consider renaming: Backup→Save, Deploy→Publish, Repair→Restore

### 📝 Important Configuration Details

**Office2 Test Installation:**
- Computer: OFFICE2
- User: Kent
- Repository: `C:\Users\Kent\rk-comp-wksp`
- Manual: `C:\Users\Kent\Documents\Rob's Computer Manual`
- Python: `C:\Users\Kent\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313`
- Web Server: http://localhost:8080

**Scheduled Tasks Created:**
- `RK-ComputerManual-WebServer` - At Logon trigger
- `RK-ComputerManual-DailyUpdate` - Daily 9:00 AM
- `RK-ComputerManual-WeeklyMaintenance` - Sunday 8:00 AM

### 🎯 Rob's Deployment Readiness

**Ready to Test:**
- ✅ PowerShell 5.1 compatibility
- ✅ Automatic Python installation detection
- ✅ System PATH configuration for scheduled tasks
- ✅ Uninstall process
- ✅ Basic Docsify navigation

**Still Needs Testing:**
- ⏳ Fresh deployment on clean Windows machine
- ⏳ Python auto-installation via winget (Rob's laptop likely doesn't have Python)
- ⏳ Scheduled task reliability across reboots/sleep cycles
- ⏳ Long-term stability (multiple days)

**Not Yet Configured:**
- ❌ Gmail notification credentials
- ❌ Desktop shortcut to open manual in browser
- ❌ Content populated with real manual instructions

```powershell
# Switch to Office2 context
cd C:\Users\Kent\rk-comp-wksp

# Pull latest fixes
git pull

# Clean installation test
cd code
.\Uninstall-RKSystem.ps1
# (Close PowerShell after uninstall to release directory locks)

# Fresh deployment (new PowerShell window as Administrator)
cd C:\Users\Kent

## Prompt for Next Chat Session

```
You are assisting with the Rob's Computer Manual project - a self-hosted Docsify documentation system that runs on Rob's Windows laptop.

**Context:** Session 3 completed Python PATH reliability fixes. The system now uses Find-PythonExecutable to locate Python even when not in PATH, and Deploy-RKSystem.ps1 adds Python to System PATH during installation. This ensures scheduled tasks can start the web server reliably.

**Current Status:** Ready for Option B complete validation testing on Office2. All critical Python PATH fixes are committed to GitHub (commit: "Fix: Make Python accessible to scheduled tasks").

**Machine Context:** We're working on Office2 (test machine) with user Kent. The repository exists at C:\Users\Kent\rk-comp-wksp. A test installation was completed but web server stopped after sleep because scheduled tasks couldn't find Python in their PATH context.

**Immediate Task:** Execute clean uninstall, pull latest changes, perform fresh deployment with Admin privileges, and validate that:
1. Python is added to System PATH
2. Web server starts immediately
3. Scheduled task can restart web server after reboot/sleep
4. All functionality works end-to-end

Refer to Session-3-Transition-2025-10-06.md in the docs folder for complete context and testing checklist.
