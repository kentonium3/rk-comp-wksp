## What Is This System?

**Rob's Computer Manual** is an automated, self-maintaining help system that runs on Rob Kanzer's Windows laptop. It provides a locally-accessible web-based manual that automatically stays up-to-date with the latest content.

### The Problem It Solves

Rob needs computer assistance from Kent, but:
- Rob shouldn't need to manually update documentation
- Rob shouldn't see technical operations happening
- Rob needs instant access to instructions in a familiar web browser
- Kent needs to know if something breaks

### The Solution

This system provides:
- **A local website** (http://localhost:8080) Rob can access anytime
- **Automatic updates** that pull new content from GitHub daily
- **Invisible operation** - Rob never sees scripts running
- **Self-healing** - Automatically fixes common problems
- **Email alerts** to Kent if something needs attention

### Key Principle: "Set It and Forget It"

Once installed, the system runs completely autonomously. Rob simply opens his browser to see the manual. Kent writes content in Obsidian, commits to GitHub, and the system automatically deploys it to Rob's machine.

└──────────────────────┘
```

### The Three Core Operations

**1. Installation (One-Time Setup)**
- Checks if Python and Git are installed (installs if missing)
- Downloads the manual content from GitHub
- Sets up automatic tasks to keep everything running
- Creates a desktop shortcut for Rob

**2. Running (Daily Operation)**
- **Web Server**: Python runs a tiny web server in the background
- **Scheduled Update**: Every morning at 6 AM, pulls new content from GitHub
- **Auto-Start**: When Rob logs in, the web server starts automatically
- **Monitoring**: Logs everything and emails Kent if there are issues

**3. Maintenance (Self-Healing)**
- If files conflict during an update, backs up Rob's version and takes GitHub's version
- If the web server stops, scheduled tasks restart it
- If components are missing, automatically reinstalls them
- Keeps 30 days of logs and automatically deletes older ones

## System Architecture

### Three-Tier Design

The system has three distinct layers that work together:

```

│                                                             │
│  • Obsidian editor - Write content in Markdown             │
│  • Git version control - Track all changes                 │
│  • GitHub push - Upload new content to cloud               │
└────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┘
                         │

│  • Repository hosting - Store all files                    │
│  • Version control - Track every change                    │
│  • Access control - Secure content                         │
│  • Always available - 99.9% uptime                         │
└────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┘
                         │
                         │ Automated Pull (Daily)
                         ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  CONSUMPTION LAYER                          │
│                  (Rob's Windows PC)                         │
│                                                             │
│  • Python web server - Serve manual on localhost:8080      │
│  • Scheduled tasks - Auto-update and auto-start            │
│  • PowerShell scripts - Orchestrate all operations         │
│  • Self-healing - Fix problems automatically               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Why This Architecture?

**Separation of Concerns:**
- Kent focuses on writing content (Authoring)
- GitHub handles reliable distribution (Distribution)
- Rob's machine handles local serving (Consumption)

**Resilience:**
- If GitHub is down, Rob still has the last version
- If Rob's internet is down, the manual still works
- Each layer can operate independently

**Simplicity:**
- Kent uses familiar tools (Obsidian, Git)
- Rob just opens a web browser
- No custom hosting or servers needed

## File Organization

### On Rob's Computer

When installed, files are organized into three main areas:

```
C:\Users\Rob\
│
├── rk-comp-wksp\                     ← Git Repository (Automated)
│   ├── code\                         ← PowerShell scripts
│   │   ├── modules\                  ← Core functionality modules

│
└── Desktop\
    └── Refresh Rob's Manual.bat     ← Desktop shortcut Rob can click
```

### Why Two Locations?

**rk-comp-wksp (Git Repository):**
- Contains the source code and scripts
- Managed by Git (downloads updates from GitHub)
- Rob never needs to look at this

**Documents\Rob's Computer Manual (Deployed Content):**
- Contains only the manual content
- This is what the web server shows
- Clean and simple for Rob

**Think of it like this:**
- `rk-comp-wksp` = The kitchen (where food is prepared)
- `Rob's Computer Manual` = The dining room (where food is served)

---

## How The System Installs

### Installation Overview

When you run `Deploy-RKSystem.ps1` as Administrator, here's what happens:

```
Step 1: Check Prerequisites
  ├─ Is Python installed? → No? → Install via winget
  ├─ Is Git installed? → No? → Install via winget
  └─ Is winget (Package Manager) available? → Must be present

Step 2: Configure System Paths
  ├─ Find where Python is installed
  ├─ Add Python to System PATH (Critical!)
  └─ Add Python Scripts to System PATH

Step 3: Download Manual Content
  ├─ Clone repository from GitHub
  ├─ Or use existing clone if present
  └─ Configure Git credentials

Step 4: Deploy Manual Content
  ├─ Copy files from rk-comp-wksp\rk-comp-man\
  └─ To Documents\Rob's Computer Manual\

Step 5: Create Scheduled Tasks
  ├─ "RK-ComputerManual-WebServer" → Starts on login
  ├─ "RK-ComputerManual-DailyUpdate" → Runs daily at 6 AM
  └─ "RK-ComputerManual-WeeklyMaintenance" → Runs Sunday 8 AM

Step 6: Create Desktop Shortcuts
  └─ "Refresh Rob's Manual.bat" → Manual update trigger

Step 7: Start Web Server
  ├─ Launch Python HTTP server on port 8080
  ├─ Verify server responds
  └─ Open browser to show Rob it works

Step 8: Final Health Check
  ├─ Test all components
  ├─ Verify scheduled tasks created
  └─ Generate initial health report
```

### Why Administrator Rights Are Required

**System PATH Modification:**
- Scheduled tasks run without Rob logged in
- They need to find Python in the System PATH
- Only Administrators can modify System PATH

**Scheduled Task Creation:**
- Windows requires Administrator rights to create scheduled tasks
- These tasks run automatically in the background

**After installation**, everything runs with normal user permissions.

---

## How The System Runs

### The Web Server: Heart of the System

**What It Does:**
The web server is a Python program that makes the manual available at `http://localhost:8080`. When Rob opens his browser to that address, Python serves the HTML and Markdown files that make up the manual.

**How It Stays Running:**

```
Traditional Approach (Doesn't Work):
  PowerShell Script → Start-Job (Background Job) → Python Web Server
  Problem: When PowerShell exits, background job dies!

Our Solution (Works Perfectly):
  PowerShell Script → Start-Process (Detached) → Python Web Server
  Result: Python runs independently, survives PowerShell exit!
```

**Technical Detail:**

In **Session 3** (Oct 6), we discovered scheduled tasks couldn't find Python because it wasn't in the System PATH. We fixed this by adding Python to System PATH during installation.

In **Session 4** (Oct 7), we discovered the web server would start but immediately stop because PowerShell background jobs (`Start-Job`) die when the parent PowerShell process exits. Scheduled tasks would launch PowerShell, run the script, create the job, then exit - killing the web server.

**The Fix:** Changed from `Start-Job` to `Start-Process` with detachment:

```powershell
# OLD WAY (Doesn't persist)
$job = Start-Job -ScriptBlock { & python -m http.server 8080 }
# When PowerShell exits, $job dies!

# NEW WAY (Persists indefinitely)
$process = Start-Process -FilePath "C:\Path\To\python.exe" `
                         -ArgumentList "-m","http.server","8080" `
                         -WindowStyle Hidden `
                         -PassThru
# Python runs independently, survives PowerShell exit!
```

This change ensures the web server:
- ✅ Starts when Rob logs in (via scheduled task)
- ✅ Stays running after PowerShell exits
- ✅ Survives computer sleep/wake cycles
- ✅ Runs invisibly in the background

### Scheduled Tasks: Automated Operations

Windows Task Scheduler runs three automated tasks:

**1. RK-ComputerManual-WebServer (Runs: At Login)**
```
Trigger: When Rob logs into Windows
Action: PowerShell runs Start-WebServer.ps1
Purpose: Ensures web server starts automatically
Hidden: Yes (Rob never sees it)
```

**2. RK-ComputerManual-DailyUpdate (Runs: Daily 6:00 AM)**
```
Trigger: Every day at 6:00 AM
Action: PowerShell runs Update-Manual.ps1
Purpose: Pull latest content from GitHub
Hidden: Yes (Rob is usually asleep)
```

**3. RK-ComputerManual-WeeklyMaintenance (Runs: Sunday 8:00 AM)**
```
Trigger: Every Sunday at 8:00 AM
Action: PowerShell runs Health-Check.ps1
Purpose: Verify system health, clean old logs
Hidden: Yes (Rob probably hasn't started work yet)
```

**Key Configuration:**
- All tasks use `-WindowStyle Hidden` so Rob never sees PowerShell windows
- All tasks use `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` to run without security prompts
- All tasks run with Rob's user permissions (not Administrator)
- All tasks use absolute paths to find Python and PowerShell scripts

### Daily Operation Flow

Here's what happens on a typical day:

```
6:00 AM - Daily Update Task Runs
  ├─ Wake up (if computer is asleep)
  ├─ Run Update-Manual.ps1
  ├─ Check GitHub for new content
  ├─ Download any changes
  ├─ Deploy to Rob's Computer Manual folder
  ├─ Log results
  └─ Send email to Kent if errors

8:00 AM - Rob Logs Into Computer
  ├─ Scheduled task triggers: RK-ComputerManual-WebServer
  ├─ Start-WebServer.ps1 runs
  ├─ Checks if web server already running
  ├─ If not running, starts Python web server
  ├─ Python serves content on port 8080
  └─ Process continues running in background

9:00 AM - Rob Needs Help
  ├─ Opens web browser
  ├─ Types: localhost:8080
  ├─ Browser shows the manual
  └─ Rob finds the answer

5:00 PM - Rob Shuts Down Computer
  ├─ Web server process stops (computer off)
  └─ Scheduled task will restart it tomorrow

Sunday 8:00 AM - Weekly Maintenance
  ├─ Run Health-Check.ps1
  ├─ Verify Python, Git, Web Server all working
  ├─ Delete logs older than 30 days
  ├─ Test email notifications
  └─ Generate health report for Kent
```

### Manual Operations

**Rob Can:**
- **Refresh Manual:** Double-click "Refresh Rob's Manual.bat" on desktop
  - Manually triggers Update-Manual.ps1
  - Shows progress window
  - "Press any key to close" when done

- **Open Manual:** Go to http://localhost:8080 in any browser
  - Works even if internet is down
  - Instant access to all documentation
  - Navigation sidebar for easy browsing

**Rob Cannot (And Doesn't Need To):**
- See PowerShell scripts running
- Interact with scheduled tasks
- Manage Git operations
- Configure the web server

**Kent Can:**
- Push new content to GitHub anytime
- Content automatically deploys to Rob within 24 hours
- Receive email alerts if anything breaks
- Remote in via AnyDesk to troubleshoot

---

## How The System Uninstalls

### Uninstallation Process

Running `Uninstall-RKSystem.ps1` performs a complete cleanup:

```
Step 1: Stop Web Server
  ├─ Find all Python processes running http.server
  └─ Gracefully terminate them

Step 2: Remove Scheduled Tasks
  ├─ Delete "RK-ComputerManual-WebServer"
  ├─ Delete "RK-ComputerManual-DailyUpdate"
  └─ Delete "RK-ComputerManual-WeeklyMaintenance"

Step 3: Remove Desktop Shortcuts
  └─ Delete "Refresh Rob's Manual.bat"

Step 4: Remove Repository
  └─ Delete C:\Users\Rob\rk-comp-wksp\

Step 5: Remove Deployed Content
  └─ Delete C:\Users\Rob\Documents\Rob's Computer Manual\

Step 6: Remove Credentials (Optional)
  └─ Delete Gmail App Password from Windows Credential Manager

Step 7: Clean Registry Entries
  └─ Remove any startup registry entries (if present)

Step 8: Summary Report
  ├─ List everything successfully removed
  ├─ List anything that failed to remove
  └─ Show cleanup statistics
```

### Safety Features

**User Confirmation:**
- Script requires typing "DELETE" to confirm (unless `-Force` flag used)
- Shows exactly what will be removed before proceeding

**Options:**
- `-KeepLogs` - Preserve log files for troubleshooting
- `-KeepCredentials` - Preserve Gmail password for reinstallation
- `-Force` - Skip confirmation prompt (careful!)
- `-Silent` - No output messages (for automation)

**Graceful Failures:**
- If a file is locked (in use), logs the error but continues
- Won't crash if components are already missing
- Provides detailed summary of what succeeded/failed

**Manual Cleanup:**
After uninstall, if anything remains:
1. Close any open PowerShell windows
2. Restart computer to release file locks
3. Manually delete remaining folders

## Component Details

### PowerShell Modules (5 Core Modules)

These modules are like toolboxes that scripts use to perform their work:

#### 1. Configuration.psm1 - Settings Manager

**Purpose:** Manage all system settings from one central file (settings.json)

**Key Features:**
- **Token Replacement:** Automatically replaces `%USERPROFILE%` with actual path
- **Path Validation:** Checks that all configured paths exist
- **Cross-Machine Compatibility:** Same settings work on any Windows computer

**Main Functions:**
```powershell
Get-RKConfig          # Load settings from settings.json
Test-RKPaths          # Verify all paths are valid
Resolve-RKTokens      # Replace %VARIABLE% with actual values
```

**Example Usage:**
```powershell
$config = Get-RKConfig
$manualPath = $config.repository.deployPath
# Returns: C:\Users\Rob\Documents\Rob's Computer Manual
```

#### 2. Logging.psm1 - Log File Manager

**Purpose:** Write detailed logs of everything that happens

**Key Features:**
- **Timestamped Entries:** Every log line shows exact date/time
- **Severity Levels:** INFO, WARN, ERROR, SUCCESS for filtering
- **Automatic Rotation:** Deletes logs older than 30 days
- **Component Tagging:** Easy to find logs from specific scripts

**Main Functions:**
```powershell
Write-RKLog           # Write a log entry
Remove-OldRKLogs      # Clean up logs older than 30 days
Get-RKLogPath         # Get path to current log file
```

**Example Log Entry:**
```
[2025-10-07 22:26:20] [OFFICE2\Kent] [SUCCESS] [WEBSERVER] Web server started successfully (PID: 21180)
```

#### 3. Notifications.psm1 - Alert System

**Purpose:** Send notifications to Kent when important events occur

**Key Features:**
- **Email via Gmail:** Uses Rob's Gmail with App Password
- **Windows Popups:** Can show toast notifications to Rob
- **Error Aggregation:** Combines multiple errors into one email
- **Configurable Levels:** Control what triggers notifications

**Main Functions:**
```powershell
Send-RKEmail          # Send email via Gmail SMTP
Show-RKNotification   # Display Windows toast notification
Send-RKAlert          # Send notification via multiple channels
```

**Example Email:**
```
Subject: Web Server Startup Failed
Body: Python executable not found. Web server cannot start.
      Please check Python installation.
```

#### 4. SystemChecks.psm1 - Health Monitor

**Purpose:** Verify all system components are working correctly

**Key Features:**
- **Python Detection:** Finds Python even if not in PATH
- **Git Configuration:** Checks Git is installed and configured
- **Web Server Status:** Tests if web server is responding
- **Repository Health:** Verifies Git repository integrity
- **Component Versions:** Tracks version numbers for troubleshooting

**Main Functions:**
```powershell
Find-PythonExecutable     # Locate Python installation
Test-RequiredComponents   # Check Python, Git, directories
Test-WebServerStatus      # Verify web server responding
Get-WebServerProcess      # Find running web server process
```

**Critical Function - Find-PythonExecutable:**
```powershell
# Searches common Python locations:
# 1. User's AppData\Local\Programs\Python
# 2. C:\Python3*
# 3. C:\Program Files\Python3*
# Returns full path to python.exe
```

This function solves the problem where scheduled tasks couldn't find Python because the PATH variable isn't available in all execution contexts.

#### 5. Recovery.psm1 - Self-Healing System

**Purpose:** Automatically fix common problems without human intervention

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic Backups:** Creates timestamped backups before risky operations
- **Conflict Resolution:** Resolves Git merge conflicts automatically
- **Graceful Recovery:** Falls back to backups if operations fail
- **User Change Preservation:** Saves any manual edits Rob might make

**Main Functions:**
```powershell
Backup-RKContent      # Create timestamped backup
Restore-RKContent     # Restore from backup
Resolve-RKConflicts   # Fix Git merge conflicts automatically
Reset-RKRepository    # Clean repository to known-good state
```

**Example Recovery Scenario:**
```
Problem: Git pull fails because Rob manually edited a file
Solution:
  1. Backup Rob's edited file
  2. Reset repository to GitHub version
  3. Log what happened
  4. Email Kent about the conflict
```

### Task Scripts (8 Automation Scripts)

#### Deploy-RKSystem.ps1 - The Installer

**Purpose:** Complete one-time setup of the entire system

**What It Does:**
1. Checks if running as Administrator (required)
2. Verifies or installs Python and Git via winget
3. **Adds Python to System PATH** (critical for scheduled tasks)
4. Clones repository from GitHub (or uses existing)
5. Copies manual content to deployment location
6. Creates three scheduled tasks
7. Creates desktop refresh shortcut
8. Starts web server for first time
9. Opens browser to show Rob it works
10. Runs complete health check

**Parameters:**
- `-SkipCredentials` - Don't configure Gmail (for testing)
- `-Force` - Overwrite existing installation

**Typical Run Time:** 2-5 minutes (depends on downloads)

#### Start-WebServer.ps1 - Web Server Manager

**Purpose:** Start and manage the Python web server that serves the manual

**What It Does:**
1. Checks if web server already running (exits if yes)
2. Runs system health check (Python, directories)
3. Finds Python executable using Find-PythonExecutable
4. Stops any existing processes on port 8080
5. **Starts Python as detached process** (Session 4 fix!)
6. Waits up to 10 seconds for server to respond
7. Tests HTTP connectivity to localhost:8080
8. Logs process ID and startup time
9. Saves process info for later management

**Critical Code (Session 4 Fix):**
```powershell
# Start Python web server as detached process
$processArgs = @(
    "-m",
    "http.server",
    $port,
    "--directory",
    "`"$docRoot`""
)

$process = Start-Process -FilePath $pythonPath `
                         -ArgumentList $processArgs `
                         -WindowStyle Hidden `
                         -PassThru

# Process runs independently of PowerShell!
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Previous version used `Start-Job` which died when PowerShell exited
- New version creates independent process that survives indefinitely
- Essential for scheduled task reliability

#### Update-Manual.ps1 - Content Updater

**Purpose:** Download latest manual content from GitHub

**What It Does:**
1. Creates backup of current content
2. Runs `git fetch` to check for updates
3. Runs `git pull` to download new content
4. If merge conflicts occur:
   - Logs the conflict
   - Preserves Rob's version in backup
   - Accepts GitHub's version
5. Copies updated content to deployment location
6. Logs all changes
7. Emails Kent if there were issues

**Smart Conflict Resolution:**
```
If Git Conflict Occurs:
  ├─ Backup conflicted files
  ├─ Run: git checkout --theirs <file>
  ├─ Continue with deployment
  └─ Email Kent: "Conflict resolved, check backup"
```

#### Health-Check.ps1 - System Diagnostic

**Purpose:** Comprehensive validation that everything is working

**What It Checks:**
```
Component Status
├─ Python: Version, PATH, working correctly
├─ Git: Version, configured, repository valid
├─ Repository: Health, remote connection, branches
├─ Web Server: Running, responding, port correct
├─ Directories: All paths exist, permissions OK
├─ Credentials: Gmail configured (optional)
└─ Network: Internet connectivity, GitHub accessible

## Technical Challenges Solved

### Challenge 1: Scheduled Task Python Access (Session 3)

**Problem:**
Scheduled tasks ran Start-WebServer.ps1 but couldn't find Python. The error was:
```
'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command
```

**Root Cause:**
- Python was installed in Rob's User PATH
- Scheduled tasks don't have access to User PATH variables
- Scheduled tasks only see System PATH

**Investigation:**
```powershell
# What scheduled tasks see:
[System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "Machine")
# Result: No Python!

# What Rob sees when logged in:
[System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "User")
# Result: Python is here!
```

**Solution (Multi-Layered):**
1. **Find-PythonExecutable Function:** Search common install locations even when Python not in PATH
2. **System PATH Modification:** Deploy-RKSystem.ps1 adds Python to System PATH (requires Admin)
3. **Absolute Paths:** Start-WebServer.ps1 uses full path to python.exe, not just "python"

**Code Implementation:**
```powershell
# Find Python
$pythonPath = Find-PythonExecutable
if (-not $pythonPath) {
    Write-Error "Python not found!"
    exit 1
}

# Add to System PATH (in Deploy-RKSystem.ps1)
if ($isAdmin) {
    $pythonDir = Split-Path $pythonPath -Parent
    $systemPath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "Machine")
    if ($systemPath -notlike "*$pythonDir*") {
        $newPath = "$systemPath;$pythonDir"
        [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $newPath, "Machine")
    }
}
```

**Result:** Scheduled tasks can now find and execute Python reliably.

### Challenge 2: Web Server Process Persistence (Session 4)

**Problem:**
Web server would start successfully but stop immediately. Scheduled task reported success (exit code 0) but web server process didn't exist.

**Symptoms:**
```powershell
# Scheduled task runs Start-WebServer.ps1
# Log shows: [SUCCESS] Web server started (Job ID: 27)
# But checking processes:
Get-Process python
# Result: No Python process running http.server!
```

**Root Cause:**
PowerShell background jobs are tied to the parent PowerShell session:
```
Scheduled Task → PowerShell.exe → Start-WebServer.ps1 → Start-Job → Python
                                                     ↓
                                              Script Completes
                                                     ↓
                                              PowerShell Exits
                                                     ↓
                                              Background Job Dies!
                                                     ↓
                                              Python Terminates
```

**Investigation Process:**
```powershell
# Test 1: Start web server manually
.\Start-WebServer.ps1
Get-Job  # Shows: Job running
Get-Process python  # Shows: Python process exists

# Test 2: Exit PowerShell and check persistence
exit
# Open new PowerShell
Get-Process python  # Shows: No process! It died!
```

**The "Aha!" Moment:**
Background jobs (`Start-Job`) are a PowerShell feature for parallel task execution within a session. They're not meant for creating long-running independent processes. When the PowerShell session ends, all jobs are automatically cleaned up.

**Solution:**
Use `Start-Process` instead of `Start-Job` to create a detached, independent process:

```powershell
# OLD CODE (Session 3)
$scriptBlock = {
    param($DocRoot, $Port, $PythonExe)
    Set-Location $DocRoot
    & $PythonExe -m http.server $Port 2>&1
}
$job = Start-Job -ScriptBlock $scriptBlock -ArgumentList $docRoot, $port, $pythonPath -Name "RK-WebServer"

# NEW CODE (Session 4)
$processArgs = @(
    "-m",
    "http.server",
    $port,
    "--directory",
    "`"$docRoot`""
)
$process = Start-Process -FilePath $pythonPath `
                         -ArgumentList $processArgs `
                         -WindowStyle Hidden `
                         -PassThru
```

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | Start-Job (Old) | Start-Process (New) |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Lifespan** | Tied to PowerShell session | Independent process |
| **Survival** | Dies when PowerShell exits | Persists indefinitely |
| **Window** | Always hidden | Controllable via -WindowStyle |
| **Purpose** | Parallel tasks in session | Long-running services |
| **Management** | Get-Job, Stop-Job | Get-Process, Stop-Process |

**Validation:**
```powershell
# Test 1: Start web server
.\Start-WebServer.ps1
# Get process ID from log: PID: 21180

# Test 2: Exit PowerShell
exit

# Test 3: New PowerShell - Check if process survived
Get-Process -Id 21180
# Result: Process still running! ✅

# Test 4: Test web access
Invoke-WebRequest http://localhost:8080
# Result: 200 OK ✅

# Test 5: Reboot computer
Restart-Computer

# Test 6: After login, check if scheduled task started it
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8080
# Result: Something listening on 8080 ✅

Start-Process http://localhost:8080
# Result: Manual loads in browser ✅
```

**Result:** Web server now persists through:
- PowerShell session exit ✅
- Computer reboots ✅
- Sleep/wake cycles ✅
- Scheduled task execution ✅

### Challenge 3: Git Workflow Across Multiple Machines

**Problem:**
Development happens on Office3, testing on Office2, but changes need to stay synchronized through GitHub. Merge conflicts and debugging changes complicated the workflow.

**Solution:**
Established clear development workflow:

```
Office3 (Development)
  ├─ Make code changes
  ├─ Test locally
  ├─ Stage only important files (VS Code)
  ├─ Commit with descriptive messages
  └─ Push to GitHub

GitHub (Source of Truth)
  └─ Stores all validated code

Office2 (Test Environment)
  ├─ Pull latest changes
  ├─ Run fresh deployment
  ├─ Validate scheduled tasks
  └─ Test real-world scenarios
```

**Git Skills Learned:**
- Selective staging in VS Code Source Control panel
- Using `git stash` to temporarily hide unwanted changes
- Resolving merge conflicts when both machines modified same files
- Proper commit messages for code history

## Configuration Management

### settings.json Structure

All system settings in one file for easy customization:

```json
{
  "system": {
    "computerName": "%COMPUTERNAME%",
    "userName": "%USERNAME%"
  },
  "repository": {
    "localPath": "%USERPROFILE%\\rk-comp-wksp",
    "remoteUrl": "https://github.com/kentonium3/rk-comp-wksp.git",
    "branch": "main",
    "deployPath": "%USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\Rob's Computer Manual"
  },
  "webServer": {
    "port": 8080,
    "docRoot": "%USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\Rob's Computer Manual",
    "startupRetries": 10,
    "startupDelaySeconds": 1
  },
  "logging": {
    "path": "%USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\Rob's Computer Manual\\logs",
    "retentionDays": 30,
    "maxFileSizeMB": 10
  },
  "email": {
    "enabled": false,
    "smtpServer": "smtp.gmail.com",
    "smtpPort": 587,
    "from": "robkanzer@robkanzer.com",
    "to": "kentgale@gmail.com",
    "credentialName": "RKComputerManual-Gmail"
  },
  "updates": {
    "autoUpdate": true,
    "updateFrequency": "Daily",
    "updateTime": "06:00"
  }
}
```

**Token Replacement:**
- `%USERPROFILE%` → `C:\Users\Rob`
- `%COMPUTERNAME%` → `ROBS-LAPTOP`
- `%USERNAME%` → `Rob`

This allows the same configuration to work on any Windows computer.
